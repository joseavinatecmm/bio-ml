# Machine Learning Capsule

## How does Machine Learning Work?

1. Data collection. 
2. Data preprocessing.
3. Data Set Splitting
4. Choosing the right model.
5. Training the model. 
6. Evaluating the model. 
7. Hyperparameter tuning and optimization.
8. Predictions and deployment.


## How to ... Data Set preprocessing? 

* Data cleaning
    * Missing Values
    * Errors
    * Outliers
    * Nomalization
    * De-duplication
* Data Reduction
    * Sampling Techniques
    * Dimensionality Reduction

## How to ... Data Set Splitting

1. Random Splitting. 
2. Stratified Splitting. 
3. Time Series Splitting. 
4. K-Fold Cross-Validation. 
5. Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation.
